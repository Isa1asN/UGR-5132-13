The Entertain page leads to another website known as www.poki.com a website where you can play many games online for free..., hence entertainment.
I made it appear on the navigation thinking students might get bored at any time so they can access it easily, and also I know that mnany students get entertained by 
games.

Another thing, the Code page:-
    I have thought through it and it is easy, the page will render the html, css, and js just using some simple javascript DOM manipulation and it does NOT HAVE error handling methods and color highlighting.
