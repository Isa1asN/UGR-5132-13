                Etorithm initially was just a telegram with only few subscribers and was used to share just few ebooks and anouncements. Also it used to be called Athenaeum Academy. The name Athenaeum was used in relation to the functions it served to its subscribers i.e. providing books. It did not have its own admins and its own website. 
                <br><br>
                <p>
                    The overall activity was all low and had few posts per week. 
                    And even the channel did not get enough attention and even it stopped posting or sharing new items. and the number of its subscribers decreased drastically.
                    Originally, the focus of Athenaeum was just fresh students of AAU/AAiT and sharing materials and the like. The channel still exists and it has only 1.2k subscribers and is still used by Etorithm.
